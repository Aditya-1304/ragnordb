//! semantic decoding boundary for RagnorDB recovery
//!
//! A-WAL validates physical framing, checksums, segment ordering, and the
//! recoverable byte prefix. This module begins the database owned portion of
//! recovery by classifying each logical WAL record and decoding recognized
//! RagnorDB payloads into validated semantic values
//!
//! decoding is intentionally separate from catalog and MVCC publication
//! Later recovery slices can validate complete history before exposing any
//! reconstructed database state
